# Image_Classification_AI

This entire project is a joint effort of:
Daksh Azad and Sudiksha Raheja of Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology


This research study is about image classification by using the Deep Neural Network (DNN) or also known as Deep Learning by using framework TensorFlow. Python is used as the programming language because it comes together with the TensorFlow framework. Deep neural network has been chosen as the best option for the training process because it produces a high percentage of accuracy.


INTRODUCTION

Recently, image classification is growing and becoming a trend among technology developers, especially with the growth of data in different parts of the industry such as e-commerce, automotive, healthcare, and gaming. The most obvious example of this technology is applied to Facebook. Facebook now can detect up to 98% accuracy in order to identify your face with only a few tagged images and classify it into your Facebook album. The technology itself almost beats the ability of humans in image classification or recognition.


WHAT IS IMAGE CLASSIFICATION

-	The classification problem is to categorize all the pixels of a digital image into one of the defined classes.
-	Image classification is the most critical use case in digital image analysis.
-	Image classification is an application of both supervised classification and unsupervised classification.

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT FILE

-	Download the zip file
-	Create a folder called “image” in your Google Drive.
-	In the folder, upload the folder “sample” and “sampleholdback”.
-	Open Google Colab and upload the python notebook there. 
-	Run all the blocks present in the notebook.
